April, 2015:

The idea of the phraser tool:

- implement cluster based algorithm for unsupervised learning of phrases

- currently I am using the phrases as computed by 
  Dekang Lin, Kenneth Church, Heng Ji, Satoshi Sekine, David Yarowsky, Shane Bergsma, Kailash Patil, Emily Pitler, 
  Rachel Lathbury, Vikram Rao, Kapil Dalwani and Sushant Narsale, New Tools for Web-Scale N-grams, 
  In LREC 2010, Valleta, Malta, May, 2010.

DONE:
 - creation of cluster dictionaries 
	/Users/gune00/data/PhrasalClusters/clusterDics

NEXT
 
 	- further subdivide the phrasal clusters
 	- identify cluster labels
 	- apply on German
 	- taxonomy/glossary extraction
 		- POS tagging of phrases
 		- extraction of phrasal grammars/patterns
 		
 		
BUILD NEMEX dictionaries
	- use with NemexF or NemexA
